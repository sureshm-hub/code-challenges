## 📝 Sample Problem Template

Here’s a quick look at the problem-solving format:

```java  
// Problem: Reverse a Linked List
// Given a linked list, reverse its nodes.  
// Input: Head of linked list  
// Output: Head of reversed list  

class Solution {  
    public ListNode reverseLinkedList(ListNode head) {  
        // Your implementation here  
    }  

    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        // Test cases and results  
    }  
}  
```
